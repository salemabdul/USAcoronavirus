# USAcoronavirus
I analyzed a data set that deals with coronavirus in the United States. I got this data set also from kaggle. I used R when I was analyzing this dataset. The variables that I was looking at were the date, state, cases, and deaths variables. I was focused mainly on the cases and deaths variables. Also, the dataset included all 50 states. There were instances where I did some filtering of the data and focus on one state. I had some graphs where I focused on the number of cases for each of the days and also the number of deaths for each of the days. I also made some graphs where I compared the number of cases and deaths for two states. There were also some instances where I decided to find the average of cases and deaths.
